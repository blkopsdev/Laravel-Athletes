His father Johnny Cain was an outstanding quarterback, back in the day at Somerset, and his grandfather John Cain is a coaching legend and a man I played for back in high school. So, Wiley’s got that going for him. He’s a big kid with a very strong arm.

He had big shoes to fill after Tre Jordan graduated and Cole utilized the senior laden group we had last year to help him execute our offense and start his own legacy. I was proud of his work ethic and his willingness to learn and improve in our system. He will now become one of our key leaders on the team even as a Junior. He stepped into the natural leadership role of QB last year and did a fine job for us and I have no doubt it will continue the remainder of his career.

Otherwise, Young’s stats would be even more impressive than they already are.“Aaron works so hard and is such a great kid,” Ortega said. “He got so much faster from his freshman year and that is because he runs track and plays basketball. The track coaches really got his speed up and he should be even faster next season because he is playing those sports again this year. Aaron carried us early in the year before Ricky (quarterback Ortega) got comfortable. Aaron has great speed and he has a knack for getting the extra yards after he is hit. The special ones do that and he is definitely that.”  He is special in that he goes out every game with a mindset to do something special to help the team win,” Ortega said. “And he works just as hard in the spring by running track and that has really made him more special. He has the speed all the special ones have and he puts in the time and work to make himself a better player.”.................No. 4 (Young), was a threat to score every time he touched the ball,” East head coach Mike Matta said. “It did not matter they threw it to him, he threw it himself or ran the football. He has elite speed and if you have one breakdown he could score from anywhere on the field. When you game-planned you had to constantly be aware of where he was, which in turn opened up areas for the other extremely talented players on the team.”..............40 Yard Dash: 4.4 Vertical: 42 Bench: 265 100 Meter Dash: 11 400 Meter Dash: 52.64..........Younger brother of '!8 DB Avery Young","ARMY, RUT, NEB, OLD DOM, SYR, MASS, UCONN",RB,48,,5,2019,SO:  http://www.hudl.com/athlete/5432486/aaron-young,"https://twitter.com/aaronyoung04  Coatesville High, 1445 E Lincoln Hwy Coatesville, PA | 19320-2493  | Phone: 610-383-3730  | Fax: 610-383-3724"
